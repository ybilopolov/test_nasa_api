Quick test draft for testing some (very few) parts of [NASA's open API](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#getting-started).

Written and tested for Python 3.6.

### Installation

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

    $ pytest tests -sv

### Notes

Tested on Linux on vanilla Python 3.6 environment with pip. 
For platforms where building scipy/numpy may be an issue (e.g. Windows)
using any of the available scientific Python distributions (e.g. conda)
is recommended.
